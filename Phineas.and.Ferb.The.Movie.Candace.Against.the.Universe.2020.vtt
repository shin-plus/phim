00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:43.023
We have no idea what that is, but Carl
is looking it up in the owner's manual.

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:46.651
Apparently,
it is a "clogged intake valve"?

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.653
Carl, this is for the washing machine.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:51.614
Oh, wait, hold on. No, this is the stereo.

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.450
Microwave instructions...

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.534
Oh, here it is!

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:55.660
Now, let's see here.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:59.748
"A member of your host family
has been abducted by aliens."

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:03.084
Wow. Candace, apparently,
has been abducted by aliens.

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.503
This is priority one, Agent P,
but remember,

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:08.214
you cannot reveal to her
that you are a secret agent.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.176
So... hmm, guess it's gonna be tricky
to rescue her.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:12.927
Heh. Well, good luck with that.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:21.353
You're right, Ferb. It doesn't look like
she did this on purpose.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.271
What's that little rectangle down there?

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.441
Bingo! Alien license plate.

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.401
She's been abducted by aliens.

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.403
Let's run those tags on the Galactic Web.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.449
FERB: It's from the planet Feebla-Oot
in the Vroblok Cluster.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.451
That must be where they're taking her.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.787
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.374
We're going to an alien planet
to rescue our sister!

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:48.296
I guess first we have to figure out how to
get to the, uh, Vrobl... the... the Vro...

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.422
The Vroblok Cluster.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:53.510
The Vroblok Cluster.
Man, try saying that five times fast.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.428
Vroblok, Vroblok, Vroblok,
Vroblok, Vroblok.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.516
Huh. I guess it's not that hard. Vroblok,
Vroblok, Vroblok, Vroblok, Vroblok.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:00.835
Vroblok, Vroblok, Vroblok,
Vroblok, Vroblok.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.170
Vroblok, Vroblok, Vroblok,
Vroblok, Vroblok.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.905
Vroblok, Vroblok, Vroblok,
Vroblok, Vroblok.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:08.191
Okay, this is not one
of Phineas and Ferb's inventions.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.527
- How can you tell?
- 'Cause of that.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.363
Whoa.

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.531
Looks like we're not the only ones
being brought here.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.483
CANDACE: What... What do you think
they want from us?

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.625
Best-case scenario, we're food.

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:29.004
That's your best-case scenario?
Man, you are dark.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.178

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.307
Oh, hey guys. You came at a great time.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.352
I was just about to start watching
my box set of Space Adventure.

Actually, Candace got abducted by aliens
and taken to another planet,

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.296
and we need your help to rescue her.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.840
Well, why did you not lead with that?

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:18.011
I suppose you will want me to build
another portal. Where is the planet?

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:20.930
That is, like, eight systems away.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:24.142
We will need a much more powerful
quantum field generator.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.268
But could we do it?

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:28.021
Yes, but even if we got
the whole gang together,

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.315
it would still take at least a montage.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.735
And we're done.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.905
Well, I guess I stand corrected.
It only took a flip wipe.

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:40.241
So, this portal will take us to
the same planet they're taking Candace to?

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:44.037
Yep. When we step through this portal,
we're gonna be on an alien planet,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.456
and we have no idea what to expect.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.291
Actually,
I took the liberty of printing out

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.835
some computer simulations
of possible scenarios.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.629
Based on the infinite possibilities,

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.547
we could be attacked by
carnivorous plants,

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.758
giant alien spiders,
flying shark creatures.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.304
Oh, here is one where we would have
to sacrifice Buford to giant alien robots.

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:04.057
- What?
- Are there any that are not terrifying?

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.143
Oh, of course.
Here is a bunch of playful puppies...

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.144
Aw.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.908
...that shoot nerve gas
from their tongues.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:10.814
Ew!

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:14.150
Look, what Baljeet is saying is,
this could get really dangerous.

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:18.154
Ferb and I appreciate your help building
the portal, but we can't ask you to go.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.115
Candace is our sister.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.867
She was pretty upset
the last time we saw her,

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.495
and I kinda feel like somehow
it's our fault.

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.748
So we're the ones
who have to make this right.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:29.833
This isn't on you.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.170
If you think you're going to
an alien planet without us,

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.172
you're even crazier than Candace.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.925
Yeah! Bring on the nerve gas puppies!

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:40.844
ALL: For Candace!

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:42.804
Thanks, you guys.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.683
Ready? Here we go.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.021
(THUMPING FOOTSTEPS)

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.189
Hello and welcome, aliens.

- (ALL SCREAM)
- Giant robot! Quick, give them Buford!

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.404
Oh, that's just Norm.
He's... He's usually harmless.

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:00.864
A... Are you guys aliens?

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.283
We're not the aliens. You're the alien.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.201
Guys, we're still in Danville!

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:08.663
All right, I guess neither of us
are aliens. But what's with your neck?

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.040
Wait, what's wrong with my neck?

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:12.876
- We're still in Danville?
- That is not possible.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.878
My calculations could not
have been that off.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.379
And why do you have a portal?

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:19.382
Well, I was trying to get to
the planet Feebla-Oot

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:22.385
in the Vro... the Vr... the... the Vro...

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:23.470
The Vroblok Cluster.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.513
Man, say that twelve times fast.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:27.500
Vroblok, Vroblok, Vroblok,
Vroblok, Vroblok, Vroblok,

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.595
Vroblok, Vroblok, Vroblok,
Vroblok, Vroblok, Vroblok.

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:32.103
Well, that was, uh, disturbing.

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.606
We have to get to Feebla-Oot
to save our sister.

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:38.109
And my daughter was apparently abducted
by an alien pod from there.

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:40.445
Here, look. Sh... She posted
on social media. Look, see?

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.280
That's Vanessa. We know her.

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:43.558
ISABELLA: And she's with Candace!

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.909
Oh, I hope my little girl is okay.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:49.996
(SHOUTS) There is an ion barrier
around the planet.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.416
Our transporters were both deflected,
which made them connect to each other.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.170
Oh, so getting there by portal
is astrologically impossible.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.880
You mean "astronomically."

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.341
No, I mean astrologically.
Here, look at my horoscope.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:04.344
"Virgo: You will be unable
to reach a planet via portal

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.764
due to it being
astronomically impossible."

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:10.433
- Okay, so I guess we're both right.
- (SIGHS)

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:14.270
If we're going to rescue Candace
and Vanessa, we need to build a spaceship.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.272
Unless anyone has one lying around.

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:21.861
I... I don't have a spaceship per se,
but I... but I do have...

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.074
my Galactic-Travel-Inator!

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:31.121
You get inside it, it flies you up to, and
I guess more to the point, through space.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.123
You mean like a spaceship?

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.709
Well, I suppose it's like a spaceship,

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:40.255
in that it operates like and performs
the exact same functions as a spaceship,

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:42.716
but it's an Inator. There's a difference.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:46.052
- Is the difference purely semantic?
- It's branding! Leave me alone.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.772
PHINEAS: Ticktock, people. We have
a sister and a daughter to rescue.

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:00.025
What is this?

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.527
My Chicken-Replace-Inator.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.362
Is that something we're gonna need?

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:08.033
Let's just say that I'd rather have
a device that makes things switch places

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:11.870
with the nearest chicken and not need it,
than need one and not have it.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:13.079
I'm with him on that.

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:15.707
Says the guy bringing a canoe into space.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.959
Hey, you don't know everything
about space.

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.095

MONOGRAM ON COMM: Wow. Okay,
that does complicate things quite a bit.

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:37.395
Remember, you can't reveal yourself
as an agent to your host family,

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:41.649
but you also can't reveal yourself
as their pet to Dr. Doofenshmirtz.

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:42.817
I guess in retrospect,

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:46.029
you are the single worst agent
we could have sent on this mission.

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:49.074
Heh. All right.
See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.034
BUFORD: Is there a barf bag
on this thing, Doc?

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.911
I'm asking for a friend.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:05.215
All right, Operation Save Candace
and Vanessa is about to begin.

Adding "thin chips" to your shopping list.

No, no, no. I said, "escape the ship."

it could fry all of the electronics

In episode 206B of Space Adventure,

00:27:16.094 --> 00:27:18.847
they were able to go through
an ion barrier without a shield

by spinning the USS Minotaur
and scattering the ions as they went.

that the writers of Space Adventure

of astrophysics than you,

I'm sure you've already
taken this into consideration. Good luck.

00:44:58.865 --> 00:45:01.618
We stopped. Whatever we did, it worked!

00:45:06.039 --> 00:45:09.542
Hmm. That's weird. No guards, no nothing.

00:45:09.626 --> 00:45:11.628
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Excuse me.

00:45:12.796 --> 00:45:15.507
The patrols will be here at any minute.
Follow us!

00:45:29.145 --> 00:45:32.607
Finally,
we have come to a place of safety.

00:45:32.691 --> 00:45:34.192
Behold!

00:45:34.275 --> 00:45:37.404
The hidden city of Cowardalia.

00:45:39.739 --> 00:45:42.200
An old dark cave. You must be very proud.

00:45:42.659 --> 00:45:45.704
Oh, this is just the cave entrance
to the city of... (GRUNTS)

00:45:45.787 --> 00:45:48.998
Borthos, every time you bring somebody
here, you do this too soon.

00:45:49.082 --> 00:45:51.459
(SIGHS) Follow me.

00:45:52.669 --> 00:45:54.671
Everyone, climb aboard.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:04.764
Behold, the city of Cowardalia.

00:46:05.598 --> 00:46:07.600
BUFORD: So, you live
in these big statues?

00:46:07.684 --> 00:46:09.561
BORTHOS: Uh, no, no, no.

00:46:09.644 --> 00:46:13.815
That's just monuments we built up.
The city is beyond those and...

00:46:13.898 --> 00:46:16.359
Oh, Borthos, come on.

00:46:23.033 --> 00:46:26.077
- (INHALES)
- The hidden city of Cowardalia.

00:46:26.536 --> 00:46:28.788
Really, Ernox? Really?

00:46:29.622 --> 00:46:31.541
(SIGHS) Make yourself at home.

00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:35.420
Borthos, you escaped from the scary ones.

00:46:35.503 --> 00:46:38.048
Did you hide under a tarp?
Did you cower under some boxes?

00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:40.675
Did you stand very still
and pretend to be modern art?

00:46:40.759 --> 00:46:44.596
No, Garnoz, we did not hide or cower
or stand still.

00:46:44.679 --> 00:46:47.849
Although Brizak over there
is an excellent example of cubism.

00:46:49.684 --> 00:46:51.561
These aliens helped us escape.

00:46:51.644 --> 00:46:52.979
Thank you for saving my people.

00:46:53.063 --> 00:46:56.816
You may hide and cower with us here
in Cowardalia as long as you wish.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.152
Thanks for the offer,
but we're worried about our sister.

00:46:59.235 --> 00:47:00.945
We've got to get back to her somehow.

00:47:01.029 --> 00:47:02.906
And I have to get back
to my daughter on Earth.

00:47:02.989 --> 00:47:06.034
We would love to help you,
but we really can't.

00:47:06.117 --> 00:47:08.078
- We're cowards.
- Let me explain.

00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:11.247
We used to be a free
and happy cowardly people.

00:47:11.664 --> 00:47:13.750
Then one day, she arrived.

00:47:16.503 --> 00:47:19.923
And she brought with her
her evil plant of doom.

00:47:21.633 --> 00:47:26.262
She sprayed us with mind-controlling
spores and put herself in charge.

00:47:28.556 --> 00:47:30.850
She forced us to build her castle...

00:47:31.976 --> 00:47:33.728
lavish her with treasures...

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.440
and make low-quality TV shows.

00:47:39.484 --> 00:47:41.319

- (BUZZ)
- (FORCED LAUGHTER)

00:47:44.739 --> 00:47:47.742
Then one day,
the spores began to disappear.

00:47:47.826 --> 00:47:50.078
Our minds became clear.

00:47:50.161 --> 00:47:52.747
So we did the only thing
that we could do...

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.917
We ran away like frightened toddlers.

00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:59.671
Sadly, some of our people
are still under her control.

00:48:01.339 --> 00:48:04.342
And now we hear
that she has found someone unique.

00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:09.222
Someone with the innate power to make
her sinister shrubbery grow once more.

(SHOUTS)

00:48:18.273 --> 00:48:21.985
- (SIGHS) You startled me.
- I see you've met Mama.

00:48:22.068 --> 00:48:23.445
This plant is your mother?

00:48:23.528 --> 00:48:28.450
No, silly. I named her after my mother,
whose name just happened to be Mama.

00:48:28.533 --> 00:48:29.534
Weird coincidence.

00:48:29.617 --> 00:48:31.619
She was also green and very controlling.

00:48:32.704 --> 00:48:37.167
Listen everyone, we came all the way
across the universe to save our sister.

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.085
And we're not going home without her.

00:48:39.169 --> 00:48:42.464
If you care about your people
as much as we care about Candace,

00:48:42.547 --> 00:48:44.341
then please help us.

00:48:44.424 --> 00:48:46.593
You do not understand. All we do is cower.

00:48:46.676 --> 00:48:50.513
We are called the cowards.
In our language it means "coward."

00:48:50.597 --> 00:48:54.601
Just because you are cowards,
doesn't mean you have to be cowards.

00:48:54.684 --> 00:48:56.978
And if you can be brave just this once,

00:48:57.062 --> 00:49:00.815
from here on,
coward could mean "mighty warrior."

00:49:00.899 --> 00:49:02.108
What do you say?

00:49:05.695 --> 00:49:07.655
- But what's it for?
- It's for you.

00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:10.116
This is why we're collecting
your Remarkalonium.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.328

Wait. Is this a treadmill?

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:33.556
Remarkalonium is Mama's lifeblood.
She'll shrivel up and die without it.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.767
- Hop up here.
- Whoa!

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:38.603
But thanks to you, now she can grow again

00:49:38.687 --> 00:49:41.606

mind-controlling spores.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:43.885
Oh, so I'm actually doing something

Wait. Mind-controlling spores?

Uh, guys. We're losing another one. Guys!

Oh, it was super easy. I lured them in
with these cheesy snacks...

No, I mean, how could you? I'd never
do something like that to my brothers.

- You already did.
- No, I didn't.

were like, "Would you? You're the best."

So I thought you were down
with the whole dungeon thing.

Wait.
You threw my brothers in the dungeon?

00:51:39.933 --> 00:51:43.520
That's not what I wanted. I love

Is it even real?

it's called "carbon dioxide." Or CO2.

Is it possible, just possible,

that this obsession you have
with controlling,

controlling the planet,
controlling your brothers,

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:30.433
is really just a distraction
from your real problem,

in the universe?

That's good. Keep going.

01:12:38.692 --> 01:12:42.112
It's just that everyone always thought
my brothers were so special.

No one paid attention to me at all.

everybody else. Wait a minute.
