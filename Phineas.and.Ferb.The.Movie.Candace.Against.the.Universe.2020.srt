maybe you shouldn't hit it.

it is a "clogged intake valve"?

Wow. Candace, apparently,
has been abducted by aliens.

183
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,503
This is priority one, Agent P,
but remember,

184
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,214
you cannot reveal to her
that you are a secret agent.

185
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,176
So... hmm, guess it's gonna be tricky
to rescue her.

186
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,927
Heh. Well, good luck with that.

187
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,353
You're right, Ferb. It doesn't look like
she did this on purpose.

188

What's that little rectangle down there?

Bingo! Alien license plate.

00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,451
That must be where they're taking her.

Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.

We're going to an alien planet
to rescue our sister!

196

get to the, uh, Vrobl... the... the Vro...

another portal. Where is the planet?

That is, like, eight systems away.

We will need a much more powerful
quantum field generator.

226
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,268
But could we do it?

227

Yes, but even if we got
the whole gang together,

228
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,315
it would still take at least a montage.

And we're done.

230
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,905
Well, I guess I stand corrected.
It only took a flip wipe.

231
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,241
So, this portal will take us to
the same planet they're taking Candace to?

232
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:44,037
Yep. When we step through this portal,
we're gonna be on an alien planet,

233
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,456
and we have no idea what to expect.

have been that off.

Well, that was, uh, disturbing.

00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,606
We have to get to Feebla-Oot
to save our sister.

278
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,109
And my daughter was apparently abducted
by an alien pod from there.

00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,445

on social media. Look, see?

That's Vanessa. We know her.

You mean like a spaceship?

297
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,709
Well, I suppose it's like a spaceship,

298
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:40,255
in that it operates like and performs
the exact same functions as a spaceship,

299
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,716
but it's an Inator. There's a difference.

- It's branding! Leave me alone.

it could fry all of the electronics

00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:24,179
Rescue me? From what?

757
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:25,930
A planet where people worship me?

758
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,849
A place where I'm finally special?

759
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:29,893
I'm the Chosen One for crying out loud.

760
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:32,645
(AUDIENCE TOGETHER)
Chosen One. Chosen One.

761
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:36,524
Oh, well, that's neat,
but, uh, chosen for what exactly?

762
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,443
To save the planet, okay?

763
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:41,738
- Ugh. Why don't you want me to be happy?
- We do, Candace.

764
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:43,365
Actually, we made you a gift.

765
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:45,700
A gift?
A gift isn't going to solve anything.

766
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:47,702
- You know what? I don't want it.
- But...

767
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:50,413
I have everything I ever wanted
right here.

768
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:53,625
She gets me. She sees me.

769
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:57,379
I finally feel like the universe
isn't against me.

770
00:38:57,462 --> 00:39:00,298
And I can't help but think, but,
you know, maybe...

771
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,133
that's because you guys aren't around.

772
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:07,889
I think perhaps
you should give her a little space.

773
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:10,767
Don't worry, Candy-cane.
I'm gonna take care of these guys.

774
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,560
Would you? You're the best.

775
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:16,439
Braxington-ton, could you find a spot
for our guests to relax?

776
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:18,983
If you'll follow me,
I'll take you to your accommodations.

777
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:23,196
Candace.

778
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:30,662
Give it up for the Chosen One.

779
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:35,000
(APPLAUSE)

780
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:38,420
I can't believe Candace.

781
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,797
I mean, I know sometimes she seems kinda...

782
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,215
- Obsessive?
- Volatile?

783
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:44,884
Enchanting? I mean, uh, terrifying.

784
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,636
I was gonna say "unhappy."

785
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,472
But I had no idea how unhappy she's been.

786
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:50,890
Here we are.

Well, you gotta admit this is a step up
from that horrifying jungle.

00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:02,986
I guess it pays to know the Chosen...

Hey, where's my canoe?

00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:11,578
- Ow!
- Oh, there it is.

793
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:21,629
Uh, guys, did anyone else happen to notice

794
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,616
that they dropped us
down a trapdoor into a shaft

795
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:27,135
then launched us into this truck
which is driving us who knows where?

796
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:31,097
Um, hi there.
Do you fellas know where this bus goes?

797
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:33,141
- We're going to prison.
- What?

798
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:36,102
That Super Super Big Doofus
sent us up the river.

799
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,313
Well, little miss
"look at all my patches,"

if you hadn't insisted on leading,

801
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:42,901
we probably wouldn't be in this mess
in the first place.

802
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:47,238
Do you see this patch?
Pray you never find out what it's for.

803
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:48,865
Okay, Isabella.

804
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:51,868

- Right. Apart from Ferb. Big fan.

806
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:59,626
The bottom line is, we're in trouble.
And I have a feeling Candace is too.

807
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,729
Thank you, Stapler Fist.
You're growing back nicely.

808
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:23,274
Be honest, does this butt make
my torso look small? (CHUCKLES)

Oh, there she is.

You don't think I was, I don't know,
a little too hard on my brothers?

814
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:42,085
Heck no, girl. You don't need them
messing up things for you.

815
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:43,670
(SIGHS) I guess you're right.

816
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:46,256
Trust me. Same story with my brothers.

817
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:48,758
Everyone thought they were so special.

818
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:49,843
So I had to...

819
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:52,721
Pardon me, Your Bigness.

820
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,726
So I had to find my own place
in the universe.

821
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,603
Just like you're doing right now.

822
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:04,107
I got to go deal with some
boring leader-y stuff.

823
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,817
You stay here. Eat, drink.

824
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,405
And don't forget to breathe... a lot.
If you need anything, just ask.

825
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,532
I do have a, a...

00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:18,079
funnel-related question.

Run.

832
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:50,779
(SIGHS) It's no use.

833
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:53,823
As soon as we get to prison,
I'm gonna start a gang.

834
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:56,034
- Who's in?
- Oh, oh. Me!

835
00:42:56,117 --> 00:42:58,703
- Anyone? Anyone at all?
- Me. Me! Me.

836
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:00,955
Maybe our new friends here
could be of some help to us.

- Hi, again.

838

There's no reason to be scared of us.

839
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:08,922
Oh, we don't need a reason.
We're afraid of a lot of things.

840
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:13,677
Things like loud noises, our shadows,
the dark, public speaking,

841
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,389
anything with wheels, large magnets,
small magnets,

842
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:22,727
water, cloudy skies, clear skies,
things from the sea, tall shelves...

843
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:33,029
And we're also afraid of monsters,
clowns, people who look like clowns,

844
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:37,450
spiders, people who look like spiders,
spiders who look like clowns,

845

cracks on the sidewalk...

Oh, great idea, Ferb.

847
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,706
Maybe if we remove
some of these components,

848
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,667
- it will stop the vehicle.
- ...making conversation at parties...

I completely forgot to tell you.

Whatever you do, do not engage in any
kind of physical conflict with the aliens.

851
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:05,895
It could put you in violation

- (WHIMPERING)
- It's working.

Also be careful not to damage

(CHUCKLES) That stuff is expensive.

And those alien insurance agencies
really stick it to ya.

BORTHOS: Uh, no, no, no.

884
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:13,815
That's just monuments we built up.

00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:31,541
(SIGHS) Make yourself at home.

889
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:35,420
Borthos, you escaped from the scary ones.

890
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:38,048
Did you hide under a tarp?
Did you cower under some boxes?

891
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:40,675
Did you stand very still
and pretend to be modern art?

892
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:44,596
No, Garnoz, we did not hide or cower
or stand still.

893
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:47,849
Although Brizak over there
is an excellent example of cubism.

894
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:51,561
These aliens helped us escape.

895
00:46:51,644 --> 00:46:52,979
Thank you for saving my people.

896
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:56,816
You may hide and cower with us here
in Cowardalia as long as you wish.

897
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,152
Thanks for the offer,
but we're worried about our sister.

898
00:46:59,235 --> 00:47:00,945
We've got to get back to her somehow.

899
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:02,906
And I have to get back
to my daughter on Earth.

900
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:06,034
We would love to help you,
but we really can't.

901
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:08,078
- We're cowards.
- Let me explain.

902
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:11,247
We used to be a free
and happy cowardly people.

903
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:13,750
Then one day, she arrived.

904
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:19,923
And she brought with her
her evil plant of doom.

905
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:26,262
She sprayed us with mind-controlling
spores and put herself in charge.

906
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:30,850
She forced us to build her castle...

907
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:33,728
lavish her with treasures...

908

1364
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:58,068
I'm so disappointed in you, Candy Corn.
We coulda been something.

1365
01:11:58,151 --> 01:12:02,906
Two girls against the universe,
side by side, and you threw it away.

1366
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:06,743
Oh, sister, you could have been special.

1367
01:12:06,826 --> 01:12:09,454
I'm not your sister. And I am special.

1368
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:11,498
- My brothers showed me that.
- BOTH: Aw.

1369
01:12:11,581 --> 01:12:13,958
- Pfft, brothers.
- And you know what?

1370
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:17,337
Maybe you should reconsider
your relationship with your brothers too.

1371
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:19,381
(SCOFFS) Why would I do that?

1372
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:22,592
Think about it.
Is it possible, just possible,

1373
01:12:22,676 --> 01:12:24,678
that this obsession you have
with controlling,

1374
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:27,097
controlling the planet,
controlling your brothers,

1375
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:30,433
is really just a distraction
from your real problem,

1376
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,727
which is how you feel about yourself?

1377
01:12:33,853 --> 01:12:37,023
You mean like a tiny, meaningless speck
in the universe?

1378
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:38,608
That's good. Keep going.

1379
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:42,112
It's just that everyone always thought
my brothers were so special.

1380
01:12:42,195 --> 01:12:44,364
No one paid attention to me at all.

1381
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:50,412
So I made myself special by controlling
everybody else. Wait a minute.

1382
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:54,332
This hasn't been about my brothers at all.
It's just been about my own self-worth.

1383

- Uh...

Listen. Listen to me.

- Yes.
- You do not have to listen to me.

- I'm confused.
- I am not going to control you anymore.

1390
